## Context
COVID-19 has infected more than 8000 people in South Korea.  
KCDC (Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention) announces the information of COVID-19 quickly and transparently.  
We make a structured dataset based on the report materials of KCDC and local governments.  
Also, we analyze and visualize the data using various data mining or visualization techniques.  

## Acknowledgements
Thanks sincerely to all the members of KCDC and local governments.

## Update
Keep in mind that the **'patient.csv'** is an incomplete dataset (getting filled).
The **'patient.csv'** could be updated slowly, because the exact information of patients is opened to the public a little late.
  
We can update quickly other data table (e.g. **'case.csv'** and **'time.csv'**) because their stuff is clearly reported by KCDC everyday.
It means that the statistical values from **'patient.csv**' could be different from those from other datasets.
Be careful when you analyze **'patient.csv'**.
